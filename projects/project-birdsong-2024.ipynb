If you listen to the audio files, you will hear that the sound is quite different between an adult (song) and a juvenile (babbling). This means we can probably process the audio files in order to decide if it corresponds to an adult or a juvenile and the goal is thus to write a function `songsort(\"./some-path/\")` that will automatically sort all the files present in `some-path` and label them accordingly.\n",
